%ILABEL Label an image
%
% L = ILABEL(IM) is a label image that indicates connected components within
% the image IM (HxW).  Each pixel in L (HxW) is an integer label that indicates
% which connected region the corresponding pixel in IM belongs to.  Region
% labels are in the range 1 to M.
%
% [L,M] = ILABEL(IM) as above but returns the value of the maximum
% label value.
%
% [L,M,PARENTS] = ILABEL(IM) as above but also returns region hierarchy
% information.  The value of PARENTS(I) is the label of the parent, or
% enclosing, region of region I.  A value of 0 indicates that the region has
% no single enclosing region, for a binary image this means the region
% touches the edge of the image, for a multilevel image it means that the
% region touches more than one other region.
%
% [L,MAXLABEL,PARENTS,CLASS] = ILABEL(IM) as above but also returns the class
% of pixels within each region.  The value of CLASS(I) is the value of the
% pixels that comprise region I.
%
% [L,MAXLABEL,PARENTS,CLASS,EDGE] = ILABEL(IM) as above but also returns an
% edge point for each region.  EDGE(I) is the index of a pixel on the
% border of region I, use IND2SUB to convert it to a coordinate.
%
% Notes::
% - This algorithm is variously known as region labelling, connectivity
%   analysis, connected component analysis, blob labelling.
% - All pixels within a region have the same value (or class).
% - This is a "low level" function, IBLOBS is a higher level interface.
% - The image can be binary or greyscale.
% - Connectivity is only performed in 2 dimensions.
% - Connectivity is performed using 4 nearest neighbours by default.
%   - To use 8-way connectivity pass a second argument of 8, eg. ILABEL(IM, 8).
%   - 8-way connectivity introduces ambiguities, a chequerboard is two blobs.
% - A MEX file is provided which is about 50x faster.
